# 0x06. Regular Expression

## Project Overview

This project focuses on building and understanding regular expressions (regex) using the Oniguruma library, which is the default regex library for Ruby. The tasks involve creating Ruby scripts that utilize regex to match specific patterns in strings. The project is designed to enhance your skills in pattern matching and text processing using regular expressions.

## Requirements

- **Editors**: vi, vim, emacs
- **Environment**: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- **Scripts**: All scripts must be executable and start with `#!/usr/bin/env ruby`
- **Regex Library**: Oniguruma

## Tasks

### 0. Simply Matching School
- **Objective**: Create a regex that matches the word "School".
- **File**: `0-simply_match_school.rb`

### 1. Repetition Token #0
- **Objective**: Develop a regex to match specific repetition patterns.
- **File**: `1-repetition_token_0.rb`

### 2. Repetition Token #1
- **Objective**: Create a regex for another set of repetition patterns.
- **File**: `2-repetition_token_1.rb`

### 3. Repetition Token #2
- **Objective**: Write a regex to match additional repetition patterns.
- **File**: `3-repetition_token_2.rb`

### 4. Repetition Token #3
- **Objective**: Formulate a regex without using square brackets to match given patterns.
- **File**: `4-repetition_token_3.rb`

### 5. Not Quite HBTN Yet
- **Objective**: Match strings starting with 'h', ending with 'n', and having any single character in between.
- **File**: `5-beginning_and_end.rb`

### 6. Call Me Maybe
- **Objective**: Match a 10-digit phone number.
- **File**: `6-phone_number.rb`

### 7. OMG WHY ARE YOU SHOUTING?
- **Objective**: Match only capital letters in a string.
- **File**: `7-OMG_WHY_ARE_YOU_SHOUTING.rb`

## Resources

- Regular expressions - basics
- Regular expressions - advanced
- Rubular for regex testing
- Interactive exercises for learning regex

## Usage

To execute any of the scripts, use the following command format:

```bash
./<script_name>.rb <string_to_match>
```

For example, to test the script for matching the word "School":

```bash
./0-simply_match_school.rb "Best School"
```
